<p>Thanks for downloading <a href="http://www.stainlessapp.com">Stainless</a>, a multi-process browser alternative to Google Chrome.</p>

<p>Each tab in Stainless runs independently in a separate process, which means:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Increased performance.<br /><i>Slow page loads (especially due to plugins such as Flash) can't affect the responsiveness of the browser or other tabs.</i> 
</li><br /><li>Increased stability.<br /> <i>Crashed pages can't bring down the browser or other tabs.</i></li>
<br /><li>Decreased memory usage.<br /> <i>Once a tab is closed, the memory for that session is completely freed to the system.</i></li></ul></p>

	<p>Stainless started out as a technology demo to showcase my own multi-processing architecture in response to Google Chrome (Stainless 0.1 was released three weeks after Google released Chrome for Windows). Sensing an opportunity and inspired by a growing fanbase, I decided to craft Stainless into a full-fledged browser and work on features that I hadn't seen before in other browsers.</p>
	<p>A prime example is <i>parallel sessions</i>, which allow you to log into a site using different credentials in separate tabs at the same time. This new technology is woven throughout Stainless, from the private cookie storage system, to <i>session-aware bookmarks</i> that remember the session in which they were saved. I still believe this is a true browser innovation (and I'd love to see this implemented in Chrome).
	 You can check it out by selecting <i>New Single Session Tab</i> from the File menu.</p>
	<p>Regrettably, over the past couple of years it's been impossible for me to keep working on Stainless and thus the <a href="https://github.com/mesadynamics/stainless">source code</a> for Stainless is now available under the MIT License for those who might be interested in continuing the project.</p>
